StochasticSQP
=============

This software is under development.  Please check back later.

Overview
--------

StochasticSQP is a software package for solving optimization problems involving a stochastic objective and deterministic constraint functions.  (Problems with deterministic objective functions can also be solved.)  It is designed to locate a minimizer of

```
min     f(x) subject to c<sub>E</sub>(x) = 0 and c<sub>I</sub>(x) <= 0, where f(x) = E[F(x,$\omega$)]
x âˆˆ R<sup>n</sup>
```

where ```f : R<sup>n</sup> -> R```, ```c<sub>E</sub> : R<sup>n</sup> -> R<sup>m<sub>E</sub></sup>```, and ```c<sub>I</sub> : R<sup>n</sup> -> R<sup>m<sub>I</sub></sup>``` are continuously differentiable.

StochasticSQP is written in Matlab.  The main author is [Frank E. Curtis](http://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/frankecurtis/).  For a list of all contributors, please see the [AUTHORS file](StochasticSQP/AUTHORS).
